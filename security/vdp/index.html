				<p class="lead"><p>Version: 1.0</p>

<p>Date Effective: 2019-05-19</p>

<p>I welcome and value vulnerability disclosures from responsible security
researchers, and I recognize the importance of the work done by the
security community. I have developed this policy to encourage and
support responsible disclosure and the crucial work done by ethical
hackers.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The following are in-scope:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My personal website at
<a href="https://u8nwxd.github.io">https://u8nwxd.github.io</a></li>
  <li>Any of projects under my <a href="https://github.com/U8NWXD">GitHub account</a>.
Note that only repositories owned by that account (U8NWXD) are
in-scope. The fact that I contribute to a repository does <em>not</em> make
it in-scope for this policy. Vulnerabilities discovered in those
projects should be reported to the project owners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything not listed as in-scope above is out-of-scope and not covered
under this policy. Note that for the sake of clarity, the following are
explicitly out-of-scope:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any physical exploits or research that involves physical access to my
person or property.</li>
  <li>Any research involving physical tresspass.</li>
  <li>Any social engineering attack. Do not send any phishing emails, for
example.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>Note that except for requirements that are explicitly restricted to
intentional acts, both intentional and accidental violations of these
requirements will constitute a violation of this policy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may not disclose any vulnerabilities without my explicit written
permission. Note that “disclosure” here includes both public and
private disclosure.</li>
  <li>You may not disrupt any services nor impair others’ ability to use any
services.</li>
  <li>You may not modify or delete any data that I host, with the exception
that you may do so temporarily only to demonstrate the vulnerability.</li>
  <li>Neither this policy nor your ability to access data constitutes
authorization for you to access that data. If you discover a
vulnerability that provides access to data that I did not intend to be
accessible to you, you may not access the data except to the extent
that is strictly necessary to demonstrate the presence of a
vulnerability.</li>
  <li>If you encounter any data that must be protected by law (e.g. protected
health information), you must not access the data and report the
vulnerability immediately.</li>
  <li>You must disclose to me, via the process described in this policy, any
vulnerabilities you discover.</li>
  <li>As much as possible, you must interact only with accounts you own or
with accounts whose owners have given you explicit, informed
permission for your activities.</li>
  <li>You must not at any time, not even when disclosing the vulnerability
or after disclosure, release any data you encounter that I did
not intend to be accessible. Note that “release” here includes both
public and private release.</li>
  <li>You must comply with all applicable laws, including those of the
United States of America. See the rest of this policy for safe harbor
provisions.</li>
  <li>You must never threaten or infringe upon anyone’s rights, safety,
property, or person.</li>
  <li>You must only work on those systems or programs listed as in-scope by
this policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="safe-harbor">Safe Harbor</h2>

<p>I consider research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conducted in good faith;</li>
  <li>Authorized for the purposes of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
and any any similar state laws;</li>
  <li>Exempt from the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA); and</li>
  <li>Lawful to the extent that the research was necessary to discover and
report the vulnerability.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will not pursue legal action against anyone based on activities that
are authorized by and compliant with this policy. However, note that
these safe-harbor provisions only apply to me. If in the course of your
research you illegally access a third party’s system, for example, that
third party may still take legal action against you, and I might not
defend you.</p>

<p><strong>Note that the above safe harbor provisions only apply to cyber-security
research conducted in compliance with this policy.</strong></p>

<h2 id="submission-details">Submission Details</h2>

<p>These details are non-binding and are only intended to give you an idea
of how I respond to vulnerability disclosures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact me using encrypted email to report the vulnerability. Details
and my public key are available from my
<a href="/security">security page</a>. Using an insecure communication method to
transmit details of a vulnerability may constitute an unauthorized
disclosure. Please include a
description of the vulnerability and detailed steps to reproduce it.
Reports should be clearly written in English.</li>
  <li>I will review your disclosure and respond within 10 business days.</li>
  <li>I may ask you for more details to help me remediate the vulnerability.</li>
  <li>I will remediate the vulnerability.</li>
  <li>I will most likely authorize you to publicly disclose the
vulnerability, disclose it myself, and publicly credit you with the
disclosure (if you so choose). I do not forsee a situation in which I
would prevent disclosure entirely, but such a situation may arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I do not offer bug bounties, but I am happy to credit you for
your work!</p>
